   problem 1.

   yyyy  mm    dd 
   
  A "resonable" date has a positive year, 
  a month between 1 and 12, AND
  a day no greater than 31 ( or less depending on the month)

   problem 2:  
		Write a function number_in_month that takes a list of dates and a
		month (i.e., an int) and returns how many dates in the list are in the
		given month.

   Problem 3:
		Write a function number_in_months that takes a list of dates and a
		list of months (i.e., an int list) and returns the number of dates in
		the list of dates that are in any of the months in the list of
		months. Assume the list of months has no number repeated. Hint: Use
		your answer to the previous problem.

(* 
   Problem 4:
		Write a function dates_in_month that takes a list of dates and a month
		(i.e., an int) and returns a list holding the dates from the argument
		list of dates that are in the month. The returned list should contain
		dates in the order they were originally given.

		Write a function dates_in_months that takes a list of dates and a
		list of months (i.e., an int list) and returns a list holding the
		dates from the argument list of dates that are in any of the months
		in the list of months. Assume the list of months has no number
		repeated. Hint: Use your answer to the previous problem and SMLâ€™s
		list-append operator (@).

 	  Problem 6: 
			Write a function get_nth that takes a list of strings and an int n and
			returns the nth element of the list where the head of the list is
			1st. Do not worry about the case where the list has too few elements:
			your function may apply hd or tl to the empty list in this case, which
			is okay.
*)

(* 
    Problem 7:
			Write a function date_to_string that takes a date and returns a string of the form 
      January 20, 2013 (for example). Use the operator ^ for concatenating
			strings and the library function Int.toString for converting an
			int to a string. For producing the month part, do not use a
			bunch of conditionals. Instead, use a list holding 12 strings
			and your answer to the previous problem. For consistency, put a
			comma following the day and use capitalized English month names:
			January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August,
			September, October, November, December.
